# Performance scripts to GHOST converter. 

# Objective
We can author robot performances utilizing the Hanson Robotics's [ webui ]( https://github.com/hansonrobotics/webui ) to deliver prepared speeches similar to a human presenter. On a different note also, we can script behaviors for artificial characters utilizing [GHOST](https://github.com/opencog/opencog/tree/master/opencog/ghost) which allows to author that cover wider range of situations in more flexible and intelligent way.

This project aims to import performance scripts authored using the aforementioned webui app to the ghost domain to enable control of our characters from GHOST pipeline most of the time.  

# Task list
The set of things to done for this endeavor are outlined in our [projects ] (https://github.com/singnet/ghost-scripts/projects/1) page.
